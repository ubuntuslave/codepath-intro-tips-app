Submitted by: **Carlos Jaramillo**

Last update: 2016/01/03

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations: just fading color on view change.
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] Bug fix: If bill value is empty, this is checked in order to avoid a crash while computing the tip out of any percentage change.
